          Hi, my name is Joshua Palamuttam and I am a Software Engineer that
          graduated from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology ’19 as a Computer
          Science Major. Currently, I am working for Kaiser Permanente for the
          Genetics Department doing research and development for different types
          of applications that Genetic Counselors and Doctors use. Previously I
          was working for DMI as a full-stack software developer, working on
          projects for Allison Transmission, and Kar Global. I am a preacher of
          clean code and have learned a lot from my time as a Software Engineer,
          at the companies previously mentioned. As a Computer Science major, I
          have worked on many projects, some of them are showcased on my
          projects page on this website, but a lot of them reside in my GitHub.
          Not only have I worked on projects but the many internships I have had
          over the years have molded me into the Software Developer I am today.
          Beyond computers, I love the outdoors and especially love hiking as
          you can see from my picture above. Not only is hiking one of my
          passions but I am an avid sports fan, I follow the San Francisco
          Giants, Golden State Warriors, San Francisco 49ers, and the San Jose
          Sharks. Based on my team’s demographics you can guess I grew up in
          Northern California more specifically San Jose, California where I
          spent my time watching big companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple
          flourish in my own backyard which also led me to love the world of
          Computer Science.
